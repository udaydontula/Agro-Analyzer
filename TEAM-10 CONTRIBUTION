Our contribution to agro analyzer project in SWECHA INTERNSHIP 2020 is making a website or an application(if time permits) which has the following features:
1. Showing loan opportunities according to farmer's annual income(whether he/she is eligible for loan or not)
2. Daily market prices of the crop in the nearby markets
3. Login page for farmers to join and get instant notifications regarding crop prices
