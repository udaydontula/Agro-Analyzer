INTRODUCTION:

   A loan waiver is the waiving of the real or potential liability of the person or party who has taken out a loan through the voluntary action of the person or party who has made the loan. 
   The waiving for the farmers is based upon the difference of the cost of cultivation and minimum support price.The major problem comes when the farmers has issues while cultivating the crop, there is when the farmer does not
   end up meeting the expectations of the consumer. Hence the farmer is unable to pay the loan, that the farmer took for the cultivation of crop.
